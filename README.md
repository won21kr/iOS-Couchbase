## Couchbase Mobile for iOS

### 301 Moved Permanently

As of August 2011 this fork is obsolete. Please see the [iOS-Couchbase-Manifest](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/iOS-Couchbase-manifest) repo for the current instructions on how to check out and build Couchbase Mobile for iOS.

Even easier: If you just want to _use_ Couchbase Mobile in your apps, we recommend downloading a pre-built framework from the [product home page](http://www.couchbase.org/get/couchbase-mobile-for-ios/current), as the source code is a bit complex to build.

Thanks, and sorry for the inconvenience!
